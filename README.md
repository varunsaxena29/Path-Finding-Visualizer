# Path Finding Visualizer

This project visualizes the A* pathfinding algorithm using Pygame. It allows users to see how the algorithm explores the grid to find the shortest path from a start point to an end point.
## Features

- Visual representation of the A* algorithm
- Interactive grid creation
- Set start and end points
- Obstacle placement


## Usage/Examples
Run the Visualizer
Left Click: Set start, end points, and place obstacles.
Right Click: Remove obstacles.
Space Bar: Start the visualization.
C Key: Clear the grid.
